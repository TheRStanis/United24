                <span class="h__FAQ">1. What are farm clans?</span>
                <p class="txt__FAQ">These are clans with automatic activation of clan reserves (boosts) in a large volume, strictly on a schedule and regardless of the number of players in the network. Players in such clans are without any obligations towards clan and participate in clan activity only by their will. Clan communication: TeamSpeak3. After joining the clan and authorization, the bot gives rights. Use at will.</p>
                <span class="h__FAQ">2. How in the farm-clan is it possible to include such a number of payments, if in one day they are prepared no more than three?</span>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">Reserves in farm-clans prepared in advance and for a long time, so in such clans included a lot of payments.</P>
                <span class="h__FAQ">3. What do clan reserves provide?</span>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">Clan reserves allow you to get bonuses based on combat results</P>
                <span class="h__FAQ">4. What are clan reserves?</span>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">- Combat Payments;</P>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">- Combat experience;</P>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">- Free experience;</P>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">- Crew experience.</P>
                <span class="h__FAQ">5. What bonuses do the reserves give?</span>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">- To credits +75% / +30%;</P>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">- To combat experience +50%;</P>

                <span class="h__FAQ">6. How to join farm-clan?</span>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">There are two ways to join farm-clan:
                    Have a high performance in the game (for each clan is different criteria);
                    To assist in the development of the clan.</P>
                <span class="h__FAQ">7. Why do we need to provide assistance to the clan, can't we make clans open to all comers?</span>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">We tried to make clans open, but faced with the problem of filling them quickly. The clan received a huge number of applications in a few hours and if everyone was accepted, the clan would instantly become stagnant. 100 players would have joined the clan and would have hardly ever left it, and we would be telling everyone that "there are no spaces and are not going to be any more". To make sure there would be places, we decided to introduce a stat limit. If a player with lower stats wants to join such a clan and assist in its development, we don't mind.</P>
                <span class="h__FAQ">8. And if the player does not have high stats and does not want about, can he join somewhere or is it necessary to assist the clan?</span>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">We can offer to join our other clans with already pumped fortification, just not with so many reserves. To do this you just need to send applications to your favorite clans.</P>
                <span class="h__FAQ">9. If I ran out of time in the clan, I'm immediately kicked?</span>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">24 hours before the expiry date, you will be sent a notice of expiry and have time to make a decision. No one is expelled from the clan without prior notice.</P>
                <span class="h__FAQ">10. What if my account is banned, do my days get burned?</span>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">In this case, you should immediately write to us and we will accept another account without any restrictions.</P>
                <span class="h__FAQ">11. If for some reason I need to leave the clan for a while, my days will be lost and how do I get back?</span>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">They will not. If you notify us, we make a note and suspend the time limit. You may return to the clan at any time.</P>
                <span class="h__FAQ">12. if I do not enter the tanks for a long time, I can be kicked out of the clan?</span>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">This is not possible. You do not have to play in the tanks. You can not go into them at all and no one will not be excluded from the clan before time. And this is not a discussion.</P>
                <span class="h__FAQ">13. In other clans, too, high requirements for the skinny?</span>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">High requirements only in clans PWNZ and M3RCY. The rest are easier to join. If the list of clans in the description states that the clan rolls sorties and GC, then the decision to join the clan takes a field commander.</P>
                <span class="h__FAQ">14. Sent an application, but for some reason it is not considered for a long time. What to do in such cases?</span>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">If there are deputies or staff officers in the clan, it is better to immediately write to them and ask them to consider your application.</P>
                <span class="h__FAQ">15. How can I make sure that everything in the farming clans works as written?</span>
                <P class="txt__FAQ">We can first send an invitation, after which you will join the clan, look at the payment log and then make a decision.</P>
